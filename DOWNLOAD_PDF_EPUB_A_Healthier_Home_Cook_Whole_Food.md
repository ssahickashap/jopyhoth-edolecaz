Reclaim your kitchen from processed foods and mystery chemicals, then cook through 75+ recipes that focus on eating well for whole-body health.
 
 With all the emphasis put on healthy eating, you probably realize how consequential your food choices are to your mental and physical health, for better or worse. But did you know that a 2017 publication from the National Institute of Health estimates that there are now more than 10,000 chemicals the FDA regulates in food (and that there are only about 100 employees doing so)?
 
 Yet you can control to improve what you’re cooking and eating—and A Healthier Home Cook provides an accessible guide for doing just that. In author Shawna Holman’s best-selling first book, A Healthier Home, she took her enthusiasm for healthy living to the page and provided an accessible, room-by-room roadmap for making the home A Little Less Toxic. Now, she’s back with a full book to support most people&amp;#039;s entry point: the kitchen and cooking. 
 
 A full basics chapter includes shopping guides for all kitchen essentials (detailing what materials to look for and avoid). Then she shares a collection of recipes, many of which help readers avoid store-bought products with questionable ingredients:
