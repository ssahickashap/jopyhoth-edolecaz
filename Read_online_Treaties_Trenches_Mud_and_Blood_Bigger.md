Overview
World War I gets the Hazardous Tales treatment in this story of warfare, treachery, strategy, and more
 
 World War I set the tone for the 20th century and introduced a new type of warfare: global, mechanical, and brutal. Nathan Hale has gathered some of the most fascinating true-life tales from the war and given them his inimitable twist. Easy to understand, funny, informative, and lively, this series is the best way to be introduced to some of the most well-known battles (and little-known secrets) of the infamous war. Each of the Bigger &amp; Badder editions of Nathan Haleâ€™s Hazardous Tales features 16 pages of new content, plus an oversize trim and a gorgeous gifty cover.
