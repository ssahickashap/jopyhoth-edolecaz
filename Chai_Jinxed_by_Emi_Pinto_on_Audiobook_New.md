Trouble is brewing at Margaret&amp;#039;s Academy of Tea and Brewing, and unlucky Misha has one chance to fix it with the recipe for the perfect enchanted cup of chai, in this magical, heartfelt, and funny adventure about the power of believing in yourself, perfect for fans of A Taste of Magic and The Marvellers. All it took was one majestic frog and a love brew gone wrongâ€”and faster than you can say ribbit, Misha got expelled...again. Things arenâ€™t much better back home. A rival tea shop opens across the street, and rumors spread that the Dayaans&amp;#039; tea is cursed. Determined to fix her familyâ€™s reputation, Mishaâ€™s only got one option left: attend the infamous Margaretâ€™s Academy of Tea and Brewing and brew her way to the top of her classâ€”even if it means a little bit of spice sabotage. But when Misha finds herself up against the girl from the tea shop across the street and things start going wrongâ€”ghostly tea leaves, living scarecrows, and rumors of missing tea witchesâ€”Misha starts to realize the truth: sheâ€™s jinxed. And if she canâ€™t turn her luck around, her family tea shop, her classmatesâ€”and even all of Margaretâ€™s Academyâ€”will have a fate worse than cold tea.Â  Emi Pinto&amp;#039;s heartfelt, hilarious, and hijinks-filled Chai Jinxed is a stand-alone adventure for everyone who has ever felt the pressure to succeed, with an affirming story about friendship, family, and self-love.
