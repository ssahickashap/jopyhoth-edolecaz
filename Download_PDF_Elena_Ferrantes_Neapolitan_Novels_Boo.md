Overview
What is it about Elena Ferrante&#039;s writing, especially her masterwork Neapolitan Novels, that resonates so deeply with millions of readers, making this Italian author who writes under a pseudonym with absolutely no &quot;platform&quot; an international sensation? Brilliantly addressing issues such as class struggle, female friendship, women&#039;s autonomy, and literary creation itself, Ferrante&#039;s hyperrealist, intense storytelling is a saga of a highly specific place and history, yet somehow also transcends them, resonating on profoundly personal levels with readers of every background. GinaÂ Frangello grew up in poverty in inner-city Chicago two decades after Ferrante&#039;s most famous characters, Lenu and Lila grew up in Naples. Despite these geographic and cultural differences, Frangello felt that Ferrante was &quot;writing about my youth, my life, my relationships, my struggles.&quot;Â  In the latest volume in the Bookmarked series, Gina Frangello contemplates Ferrante&#039;s Neapolitan novels through the lens of memoir, literary criticism, and issues of authorial identity and gender. Should who Ferrante &quot;is&quot; matter? And more importantly, what is it about Lenu and Lila&#039;s story that taps into such universal truths that makes readers feel that Ferrante is writing specifically to them?Â
