The man who broke her heartâ€¦
 
 Must now be her protector.
 
 Maggie Scott has worked hard to become an assistant curator at the Larimer Museum. But following the theft of a rare, priceless jewel and the murder of her fellow employee and friend, Maggie is suspected of complicity. Only investigator Kevin Lombard believes in her innocence. But thanks to their shared history, he&amp;#039;s hardly objective. In fact, this may be the second chance he never thought possible. First, though, he must prove Maggieâ€™s innocenceâ€¦and protect the woman he never forgot from whoever is out to get her.
